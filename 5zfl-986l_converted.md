# RESULTS

## Nanolaminate processing

> PMMA/Gr nanolaminates were fabricated by imple- menting the
> semiautomatic iterative lift off and float on combined with the
> wet-deposition technique \[[14](#_bookmark19),[15](#_bookmark20)\].
> The atomic force microscope (AFM) image of CVD Gr on a Cu substrate
> shown in Fig. [1(a)](#_bookmark4) indicates a relatively low wrin- kle
> height (approximately 6 nm). The CVD graphene also exhibits large
> grain sizes (*\>*90 μm) \[[14](#_bookmark19)\]. The samples are
>
> labeled as PMMA/Gr~*φ*Gr~, where *φ*~Gr~ denotes the per cent volume
> fraction of Gr. The total thicknesses of the sam- ples as well as the
> correlation of the Gr volume fraction with the thickness of each PMMA
> layer are listed in Table S1 within the Supplemental Material.
> UV-vis-NIR and Raman techniques are utilized to characterize the
> quality of PMMA/Gr nanolaminates. Figure [1(b)](#_bookmark4) shows
> represen- tative UV-vis-NIR transmittance spectra of (PMMA/Gr)*~n~*,
> where *n* denotes the number of Gr layers. The corre-
>
> sponding transmittance should amount to 87.0%, 49.8%, and 31.2% for
> repeating cycles *n* = 6, 30, and 50, respec- tively, since visible
> light absorption of Gr is 2.3% \[[16](#_bookmark21)\]. The
> experimental transmittance shows consistency with the computed values,
> indicating each Gr layer remains
>
> almost intact during the wet-transfer process. Raman spec- tra in Fig.
> [1(c)](#_bookmark4) shows the intensity ratio of the *D* peak to *G*
> peak, *I* (D)/*I* (G) ∼ 0.17, indicating almost negligi- ble defects
> in Gr fillers \[[17](#_bookmark22)\]. Meanwhile, as a previous study
> \[[18](#_bookmark23)\] suggests, the nearly unchangeable peak posi-
>
> tions for multiple stacking \[black dashed lines in Fig.
> [1(c)](#_bookmark4)\] indicate that no residual stresses are developed
> in the nanolaminates after the fabrication process. These charac-
> terizations demonstrate the high quality of the PMMA/Gr nanolaminates,
> which is a prerequisite for high thermal conduction materials.

>
> PMMA chain estimated from *p*-IR measurement is shown in Fig.
> [3(b)](#_bookmark6) as white arrows superimposed to the distribu- tion
> of *p*-IR absorption at 1242 cm^−1^. The cross section of the PMMA/Gr
> film was embedded in epoxy matrix, and the film cross section
> \[bordered by red line in Fig. [3(b)](#_bookmark6)\] is oriented along
> *ψ* = 124° direction. The Hermans

> calculated from the
>
> absorbance, indicates the overall in-plane orientation of the
>
> PMMA \[[15](#_bookmark20),[30](#_bookmark34)\]. As the spatial
> resolution of *p*-IR imaging is limited by the diffraction limit, the
> image pixel size was effectively 6.25 µm.
>
> Nanoscale analysis was further performed by nano- FTIR with broadband
> illumination and IR s-SNOM com- bined with a quantum cascade laser
> (QCL). The Pt*/*Ir coated AFM cantilever was mechanically modulated
> and irradiated by broadband illumination/QCL. The scattered light was

> optical properties under the tip. The imaginary part of the scattered
> electromagnetic field relates to the absorption of the sample surface.
> There-
>
> fore, the absorption of nano-FTIR and IR s-SNOM can be defined as, *a*
> = Im\[*σ* \]. The distribution of *a* at 1145 cm−1 from the cross
> section of PMMA/Gr~0.07%~ at 1145 cm^−1^ by s-SNOM is shown in Fig.
> [3(c)](#_bookmark6). (Broadband mid-IR
>
> spectra for the same locations were also identified in nano- FTIR
> \[[15](#_bookmark20)\].) Periodic high values in the relevant Gr layer
> are detected (white arrows), and the periodicity is in good agreement
> with the predicted value of about 400 nm. The Gr region is considered
> to have a high value of imaginary part of scattering coefficient, due

>
> Due to the strong coupling effect between the tip and the Gr, absolute

## Modeling the thermal conductivity

> We employed modified parallel and series models to represent the
> thermal conductivity in two directions. In these models, we introduced
> a term for the thermal conduc- tivity of oriented PMMA layers,
> *κ*~PMMA,O~, which includes both the highly oriented PMMA near the
> interface and a next outer layer, with thickness of 2*R*~g~, perturbed
> by the former according to simulation work \[[25](#_bookmark30)\]. The
> oriented PMMA chains are not flattened in a 2D plane or direction but
> at an oblique angle. As shown in Fig. [3(f)](#_bookmark6), their
> spatial arrangement can influence both in-plane and cross-plane
> thermal conduction. Therefore, the parallel model can be

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

> Previous results indicate that decreasing interfaces between filler
> and matrix reduces the total thermal resis- tance and weakens the
> phonon scattering \[[6](#_bookmark11)\]. Unprece- dently, we found
> that the unmodulated Gr can align PMMA chains. Oriented polymers
> possess thermal con- ductivity of orders of magnitude higher than the
> bulk because of the restricted interchain hopping and the improved
> intrachain thermal transport
> \[[11](#_bookmark16),[12](#_bookmark17),[74](#_bookmark47),[75](#_bookmark48)\].
> We demonstrate that the PMMA chains near the interface show
> preferential in-plane orientation, which in turn enhances the thermal
> conductivity of the PMMA/Gr nanolaminates in both directions. This
> view diverges from conventional beliefs that interface in the
> nanocomposites can reduce thermal performance
> \[[5](#_bookmark10),[6](#_bookmark11)\]. We infer that in previously
> studied randomly dispersed Gr nanocomposites, the nanos- tructure of
> the aligned PMMA is not fully taken advantage of, resulting in limited
> thermal conductivity enhancement. It is worthwhile to note that the
> large graphene sheet may be crossed by bridges at regular intervals.
> It is pos- sible that at same points the wrinkles of two neighboring
> graphene layers approaching each other with quite a thin layer of PMMA
> between them and lead to high electri- cal and heat conduction, due to
> the ballistic and tunneling effect. This picture is quite reasonable
> for electronic trans- port but may be a problem with thermal
> transport. Due to the lack of periodic lattice in amorphous polymers,
> atomic vibrations described by the phonon picture is always a set-
> tlement. The vibration modes in polymers are categories as propagons,
> diffusons, and locons, where diffusons are the main heat carriers
> \[[76](#_bookmark49)\]. Therefore, the phonons in graphene cannot
> tunnel through PMMA. However, recent works show that disordered
> materials can have a phonon- like mode, which can propagate hundreds
> of nanometers, supporting the phonon gas picture
> \[[77](#_bookmark50),[78](#_bookmark51)\]. Although the measured
> thermal conductivity behavior in Fig. [2](#_bookmark5) can- not be
> fully captured by the "phonon bridge" picture, it is possible that the
> wrinkled graphene may contribute to the measured cross-plane thermal
> conductivity, which is
>
> worthy of further investigation.
>
> In conclusion, exploiting the iterative "lift-off and float- on" wet
> transfer method to fabricate PMMA/Gr nanolam- inates samples in even
> higher volume fractions has led to
>
> the achievement of ultrahigh in-plane thermal conductiv- ity and
> anisotropic conduction. The PMMA/Gr nanolam- inates show a superhigh
> in-plane thermal conductivity of
>
> 8.9 W m^−1^ K^−1^ and high anisotropy of 53 at Gr loadings of 1 vol.
> %. The ultrahigh in-plane thermal conductivity is attributed to the
> perfect Gr alignment and increase of
>
> *κ*~PMMA~ in this direction, while the increase in cross-plane
> direction can be rationalized to the contribution of PMMA orientation.
> The results are key to understand the heat dissi- pation and thermal
> management mechanisms of Gr-based nanocomposites for their
> applications as TIMs.
